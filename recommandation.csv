<p>Beginning in London in 2014 and then moving to Berlin in 2016, the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) staged two unique Logan Symposia (www.logancij.com), with support from The Reva &amp; David Logan Foundation. Both brought together investigative reporters, ethical hackers, intellectuals and artists in a genuinely mould-breaking combination to challenge power and to defend freedom and democracy. Encouraged by their success the CIJ now wants to build that energy and momentum into an ongoing series of symposia in the UK and other countries, as well as a vibrant, controversial programme of debates and events in our new home at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>

<p>The Logan Curator is a fantastic opportunity for an experienced, imaginative conference organiser/curator to build their reputation on an international scale. Working together with the guidance of a small editorial board, the curator will take on the role of cultivating the institutional memory of LOGAN and its network of collaborators (our speakers include everyone from Seymour Hersh to Edward Snowden) and preparing the ground for our third major symposium in Goldsmiths University in Autumn 2018 and beyond. The job requires ruthless efficiency with logistics and marketing, experience of organising complex events, sometimes across borders, and the ability to build local, national and international audiences - all led by a facility with radical and sometimes dangerous ideas.</p>

<p>The ability to work collaboratively and to report to an editorial board, to define and manage editorial and budgetary expectations and to make regular progress reports to the CIJ Director and Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>Experience in actively building audiences, and in entrepreneurially marketing high-profile events over a range of target groups.</p>

<p>An enthusiasm for politics and contemporary culture, and for radical new ideas and the avant-garde.</p>

<p>A technical understanding of new media technologies including video streaming and encryption. The ability to update a website with new media material and to plan a new media publishing operation.</p>

<p>The interpersonal skills required to work with a wide range of VIPs and the CIJs international network of journalists and practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>DESIRABLE SKILLS</strong></p>

						<p>The Good Support Group Limited is an ethical business, 100% owned by The London Borough of Newham. The company provides a range of direct social care services to adults and young people.</p>

<p>Working in partnership with adult social care commissioners, we are involved in the development of an innovative home care delivery model pilot project. The pilot will establish teams of workers to deliver care and support to customers in community neighbourhood areas. The model is intended to improve outcomes, quality and continuity of care by facilitation of a culture of largely self-managing teams, working in a non-hierarchical, although accountable, structure; allowing care workers to be more flexible and customer-focused. As the Pilot Lead, you will drive the development and implementation of the pilot and project-manage it’s implementation.</p>

<p>Similar models in countries such as the Netherlands and the USA indicate that outcomes achieved through adopting a neighbourhood care approach can increase customer and care worker satisfaction, providing care that is high quality and more efficient in achieving commissioned outcomes. The pilot will be evaluated as a research project to determine efficacy.</p>

<p>We are looking for an appropriately experienced social care professional, with knowledge of the home care sector and a successful track record in managing projects. This might include, experience of establishing new offices and operations, implementing new contracts or transferable skills from a related sector.

We are not looking to replicate the predominant time and task model of much of publically funded homecare. We need someone who will enjoy the challenge of doing things intelligently, differently and better.</p>

Islington is also one of a small number of ‘Partners in Practice’ local authorities in the country.

        Project Manager- Contract<br><br> 6 months + with a possibility of going perm <br><br> Cambridge<br><br> This is a new venture for an expanding hi-tech company in Cambridge who are looking for a Project Manager to come in and take ownership of a range of projects working closely with various in-house technical teams. Traditionally the company have shared project responsibly between engineers but now as a result of a new area they need an established Project Manager to come in and implement procedures, and work closely with engineers to help the company create a more efficient approach to overall project management. <br><br> The bulk of the projects will work on principles involving mechanical, electronic, software and optics so the Project Manager will need a background of working closely with R&amp;D on technical products which encompass these core areas. You could expect to run multiple projects at any one time typically with 3 or 4 larger value projects with durations which can vary to potentially as long as 18 months. You will also help to manage various tasks such as ISO processes and meetings and generally making sure that a forward thinking approach is being adopted in relation to project management. <br><br> As this is a totally new role for the company the ideal scenario would be to bring a candidate in on a contract basis with a view to potentially going permanent in the future although out and out contractors will also be considered. <br><br> <br><br>

<p><strong>Software testing</strong> is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy)" title="Quality (philosophy)">quality</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a> product or service under test.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-Kaner_1-1">[1]</a> &nbsp;Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the &nbsp;software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks &nbsp;of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of &nbsp;executing a program or application with the intent of finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">software bugs</a> (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use.</p>
<p>Software testing involves the execution of a software component or &nbsp;system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In &nbsp;general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or &nbsp;system under test</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
  <li>meets the requirements that guided its design and development,</li>
  <li>responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,</li>
  <li>performs its functions within an acceptable time,</li>

  <li>can be installed and run in its intended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_environment" title="Operating environment">environments</a>, and</li>
  <li>achieves the general result its stakeholders desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the number of possible tests for even simple software components &nbsp;is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to &nbsp;select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources. As a &nbsp;result, software testing typically (but not exclusively) attempts to &nbsp;execute a program or application with the intent of finding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">software bugs</a> &nbsp;(errors or other defects). The job of testing is an iterative process &nbsp;as when one bug is fixed, it can illuminate other, deeper bugs, or can &nbsp;even create new ones.</p>
<p>Software testing can provide objective, independent information about &nbsp;the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#cite_note-Kaner_1-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Software testing can be conducted as soon as executable software (even if partially complete) exists. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process" title="Software development process">overall approach to software development</a> &nbsp;often determines when and how testing is conducted. For example, in a &nbsp;phased process, most testing occurs after system requirements have been &nbsp;defined and then implemented in testable programs. In contrast, under an &nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">agile approach</a>, requirements, programming, and testing are often done concurrently.</p>

						<p>Apprenticeships are playing an increasingly important role in equipping people with the right skills to meet employers’ needs for the 21st Century.

<p>We were established in April 2017 and whilst still a relatively new organisation we have already achieved a great deal; we are supporting over 250 trailblazers (and over 2600 employers) with 215 apprenticeship standards already published and a further 300 in development.  We are fully staffed with a group of talented and motivated individuals from a variety of backgrounds who are making our operational plan a reality.  Nevertheless, there is still more to do. Our role is set to expand over the course of the next year as we take on new responsibilities in relation to classroom-based technical education.  In addition, whilst we have established our structures and governance to deliver our core functions, we now need to focus on streamlining and improving our approach, taking into account feedback from stakeholders.</p>

<p>In this newly created role, you will take the lead in delivering the growth ambitions that we have.  Reporting directly to the Chief Executive and forming part of the wider leadership team, you will ensure the smooth delivery of daily operations, in particular, the efficient and effective delivery of the Institute’s core function; to drive up the quality of apprenticeships and technical education in England by reviewing and approving employer-designed standards and assessment plans.  Responsible, initially for a direct team of six Deputy Directors, you will be accountable for the operation and development of your teams and for managing their performance, with a wider responsibility for 80 staff and a budget of circa £8 million.</p>
